== Notable Changes

=== Refactored signal `RenderNode`

The signal's return attribute Context has been replaced by its new
Context and SetContext methods. The newly added RawContext should not
be used directly.

== Upgrade from 0.13.0

Sites should be able to run and compile without changes.

You possibly have to fix your use of the RenderNode signal.
